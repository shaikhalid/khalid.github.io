Hi, I am Khalid. I like Software Programming.

Currently I am pursuing masters in Computer Science at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/).

Previously I worked as a Senior SDE at [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) 
and I have also worked as an SDE at [Swift Robotics](https://swiftrobotics.ai/) building disinfection robots for SARS-CoV-2.

I enjoy watching Podcasts and  educational content on Youtube.
