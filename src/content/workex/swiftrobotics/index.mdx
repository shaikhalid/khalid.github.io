- **Implemented ORB-SLAM2 for COVID-19 disinfection robots**, achieving precise navigation in complex settings.
- **Performed Sensor Fusion** on Wheel + Visual Odometry and IMU Data, resulting in a **60% reduction in localization error** to an average of 7cm after 30 mins of operation in real-world scenarios.
- **Developed a React Native app** to control and visualize the robot using the Animated API and implemented state management through Redux.
